# House-Price-Prediction-Model-Project
This project aims to predict house prices using machine learning. The model is built using a dataset with multiple features that influence house prices, such as the number of rooms, location, and other attributes. The project demonstrates the process of data preprocessing, model training, and deployment using Flask for prediction via a web interface.

## Project Overview

This project involves building a machine learning model to predict house prices based on various input features. The steps involved include:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Feature engineering
- Model selection and training
- Model evaluation
- Saving the trained model

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Programming language used for data analysis and model building.
- **Scikit-learn**: A machine learning library used for building and training the prediction model.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
- **Joblib**: To save and load the trained model.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: For data visualization.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains various features about houses (e.g., size, location, number of rooms) and their corresponding prices. The dataset can be loaded into the project as a CSV file. Ensure that the dataset is structured correctly with the necessary columns for the model.

Sample data can look like this:
- Square footage of the house
- Number of bedrooms
- Number of bathrooms
- Location/Neighborhood
- Year built

## Steps Involved

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and prepare the data by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
2. **Model Training**: A regression model (e.g., Random Forest, Linear Regression) is trained using the dataset.
3. **Model Evaluation**: The model is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared to ensure accurate predictions.
4. **Model Saving**: The trained model is saved using `joblib` for later use.


## How to Run the Project

### Prerequisites
To run the project, you need to have the following Python packages installed:
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- joblib
- matplotlib
- seaborn

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Steps to Run Locally

1. **Clone the repository**:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/house-price-prediction.git
cd house-price-prediction
```

2. **Train the model** (if the model isn't saved yet):

   Open a Jupyter notebook or Python script to train the model. This involves loading the dataset, preprocessing it, training the model, and saving the model using `joblib`.

   Example:

   ```python
   import joblib
   from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
   # Your code to load data and train the model
   model = RandomForestRegressor()
   model.fit(X_train, y_train)
   joblib.dump(model, 'house_price_model.pkl')
   ```
